 3d wario up in this source

 needs source sdk 2013 singleplayer

READ THIS!!!!!
the intro logo animation (currently) is 600 mb and cannot be pushed to github, so it has been stored in a rar
if you want to see the animation work ingame, extract it yourself

right now some stuff is disabled, so if you want to play the game properly, load any of the dev_test maps and enable thirdperson and r_camera_cinematic
